# Digital Covid Certificate - Austrian Rule Sets

The goal of this project is to maintain a set of covid certificate business
rule sets that are applicable in Austria.

Maintained sets:

* **TUGRAZ:** The rules for accessing a building of the TU Graz

The format of the specific rules follows the official EU-DCC standard as
described here:
https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgc-business-rules-testdata

The format of the rule sets mirrors the CBOR encoded business rules as described
here: https://github.com/Federal-Ministry-of-Health-AT/green-pass-overview

Feel free contribute your own set.
